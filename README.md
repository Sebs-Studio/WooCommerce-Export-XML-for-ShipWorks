WooCommerce Export XML for ShipWorks
====================================

Plugin Description: Allows you to export your orders as an XML file to import into ShipWorks. Either select from a date range or export all orders.

WooCommerce Export XML for ShipWorks is a commercial plugin available from [http://www.sebs-studio.com]. The plugin is hosted here on a public Github repository in order to better faciliate commuity contributions from developers and users alike.

I do ask, however, that if you are using the plugin on a live site that you please purchase a valid license from the website. I cannot provide support to anyone that does not hold a valid license key.

Thank you.
